            Recently, I've developed a strong interest in Generative AI, which has become a focal point of my
            professional growth. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects that
            leveraged the power of AI to create innovative solutions. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continue learning in this ever-evolving field of
            technology.

            Outside of technology, I have a passion for hiking, sports, and cycling. Iâ€™ve
            also played football at the I-League and inter-district tournament levels,
            which has taught me valuable teamwork and perseverance skills.
